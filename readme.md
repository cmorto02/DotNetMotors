# Numbers Game 

## Lab05 and LAB06-DotNetMotors

### Author: Chris Morton

### Description

This project was to demonstrate understanding of the OOP principles. We were to design a vehicle dealership heirarchy.

The OOP Principles are

#### Abstraction:
Where you have a parent class and you abstract child classes to be able to give them different properties or methods that may not be related to the others that are encompased in the parent class. In this project we abstracted multiple classes from the parent class of vehicle.

#### Polymorphism:
Where different classes use the same method in different ways. We made trains honk a different message than cars.

#### Inheritance:
Receiving existing properties or methods from existing classes. From the parent class of Vehicles all of our concrete classes received the method TurnOn()

#### Encapsulation:
When a group of methods and properties are treated as a single thing. We achieved encapsulation by creating many individual classes to describe different things. All of the methods and properties within that class are treated as one package.

An interface is something that allows us to group together items that are not in the same heirarchical branch. In our example we used the AdvancedTraining and the NotClaustrophobic Interfaces with Air and Tracks and Air and Under classes respectively. The AdvancedTraining interfaces is to be used on classes that require advanced training and the NotClaustrophobic is used on classes where the operator should not be claustrophobic.
